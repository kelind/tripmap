tripmap
====

A tutorial on the Basemap package using data from a trip that I took. Covers basic plotting in Basemap: setting up the map, using projections, and adding data.

Requirements
====

The tutorial requires only Matplotlib and Basemap. I found it a bit difficult to get Basemap installed myself; what ultimately worked was installing via [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/basemap).

Installation
===

Clone the repository.

`clone https://github.com/kelind/tripmap.git`

The tutorial itself, which uses a subset of the data, is included in the Jupyter notebook file `tutorial.ipynb`. To generate the final map I used myself, run `plot_trip_coords.py` instead.
